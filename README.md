# Resources for Induction

Here is a set of resources that will help you out to learn and explore the various topics going to be taught in your induction. This is not exhaustive, and will keep on updating as we continue with the induction.

## 1) Standard Template Library (STL)

STL is a library in C++ which allows you to make use of various data structures and algorithms (DSA), without having to implement them yourself.

There are a lot of DSAs that are part of this.

- Get started: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltBdTiRgSaw)

> This will introduce you to the basics of how to get started with STL

- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-stl-tutorial/)

> Once you are done, you can get started with these. This is a compilation of most of the DSAs in STL.

## 2) Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)

- A good [introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_oop.asp)

## 3) OpenCV

- As always, the Documentation is always good, but way too general: [here](https://docs.opencv.org/4.7.0/)

- Introduction: [C++](https://github.com/murtazahassan/Learn-OpenCV-cpp-in-4-Hours) and [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQeoO7MI0Bs)

> Pretty long. Recommended to look a the code given and see the end products. You can skip over the part where the code is being written. Don't worry, it won't take more than 2 hours to familiarize yourself

- Knowing the concepts always helps: [Theory](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee368/handouts.html)

- YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection system that uses a deep neural network and is implemented using the Darknet neural network framework. The Darknet framework is an open-source neural network framework written in C and CUDA, and it is optimized for both CPU and GPU computing.[Official Github Repo](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)

## 4) Python

Here are some Python codes for [robotics algorithms](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics)
 
> This is optional.

- Once you are familiar with this, moving on to solving some [examples](!!!!!!)
